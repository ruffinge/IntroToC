This book is intended to be a starting point for an introduction to programming
in the C programming language. It is not intended to be a complete,
comprehensive guide, but instead to provide a cursory introduction to important
concepts and theories relating to programming, both in general and in C.

Given that this book is not intended to cover any topic in depth, the reader may
find himself looking for further information on a variety of the topics covered.

The following is a brief list of some excellent resources for such information:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{The C Programming Language}, 2nd Edition, by Brain Kernighan and 
		Dennis Ritchie for nearly any and all questions you may have about C. This
		is a \emph{strongly} recommended book for gaining a true mastery of the
		language.
	\item Ethan Ruffing's \emph{C Style Guide} (available at
		\url{https://github.com/ruffinge/CStyleGuide}) for information on style
		consistency and programming conventions.
\end{itemize}
